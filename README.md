# CLASSIFYING-SONG-GENRES-FROM-AUDIO-DATA
Using ML classifiers on audio data

This is a part of Datacamp's structured projects. 
The project focuses on applying two popular classifiers (Decision Tree & Logistic Regression) to audio data with 10 features (acousticness, danceability,...) which have been scored by EchoNest on a scale of -1 to 1. The project features the importance of PCA when data is of high dimension and also outlines model bias in classification problems when the sample size of classes are not balanced.

Enjoy!
